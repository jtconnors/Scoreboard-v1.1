/*
 * Common behavior for nodes that accept keyboard and mouse focus.  Among
 * the capabilies included are:
 *   1. Animation which expands the size of the node when the node is
 *      in focus (either by mouseover event or keyboard focus)
 *   2. Mechanism to set up node focus traversal to the left and right based
 *      upon keyboard input.
 *   3. Means to associate an action which will be invoked by a mouse press.
 *      That same action can be used when a keyboard enter takes place on
 *      a node in focus.
