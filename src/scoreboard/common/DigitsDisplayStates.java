/*
 * Classes that represent a number display with multiple digits normally
 * just support the display of digits in regular fashion.  For example,
 * a TwoDigit implementation would display the overallValue 9 as "9",
 * where the leftmost digit would be blank. One exception (are there more?)
 * to this rule deals with using a TwoDigit implementation as the basis
 * for representing player numbers.  When the allowTrailingZeroes property
 * is set to true, it is possible to display non-standard
 * numbers like "00" or "09".  The DigitsDisplayStates enum defines
 * the possible display states that can be encountered.
