Bug Fixes:

[Fixed]	Fix MainRemoteClockOnly.java bug.  File URL referenced points to
	file:///C:/Users/jtconnor...  which won't work on any other system
	Point URL to a config file in the Scoreboard.jar instead

[Fixed]	Bug displaying player number.  If number ends in 0 (i.e. 10, 20, 30),
        that digit is blank.

Enhancements:

[Done]	Fully implement Horn (add sound)
	[Done]	Manual horn button
	[Done]  Sound horn when clock reaches zero

	[Done]	Option for alternate horn sound - hornURL:URL
	[Done]	Sound horn for as long as mouse is held down on horn button
                or until MP3 file representing sound finishes

[Done]  Reorganize packages and code structure
        [Done]  Separate out Globals, most go to scoreboard.common,
                the ones specific to JavaFX go to scoreboard.fx2.framework
        [Done]  Eliminate scoreboard.common.xml package.  Move those source
                files into scoreboard.fx2.framework and make them base
                abstract classes.
        [Done]  Create a scoreboard.fx2.framework.hockey package
                containing the implementation classes specific for a hockey
                scoreboard.  The classes extend ones found in
                scoreboard.fx2.framework
        [Done]  Eliminate scoreboard.common.networking.simple package and
                move those classes into Test Packages.

[Done]  Global debugFlags variable with -debug:value command-line switch

[Done]  Allow Penalty player numbers to have a zero prefix (i.e. "00", "06" ...)
