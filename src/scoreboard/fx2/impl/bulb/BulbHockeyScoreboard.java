 * This class extends the abstract Scoreboard class and must be written in
 * the following way:
 *    1. The constructor must call super(digitColor, digitHeight) first.
 *    2. A Specific implementation for the following abstract classes
 *       must already be created: Digit, SingleDigit, TwoDigit,
 *       Clock, Penalty.
 *    3. Once done, the slew of variables (defined in the
 *       super class) must be assigned and allocated an object
 *       of type defined by one of the implemented classes above.
 *       This has to be placed inside the constructor immediately after
 *       the call to super(...).
 *    4. Follwing the Digit allocations, a call to init()
 *       (defined in the super class) must be made in the constructor.
